📊 Our Analysis Approach

We examined engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies, quotes, bookmarks) to measure ad impact.
Using VADER (NLTK), we conducted sentiment analysis on tweets to evaluate brand perception by:
	•	Brands 🏢
	•	Celebrities 🎭
	•	Geographic regions (state-level sentiment) 🌍

2️⃣ Stock Market Correlation

We analyzed how brands’ Super Bowl ad performance correlated with their stock performance.
	•	Stock changes were measured from the Friday before the Super Bowl to the Friday after (1-week window).
	•	Findings revealed key relationships between ad sentiment and stock movements.

🏅 Competition & Recognition
